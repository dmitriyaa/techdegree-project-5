# CSS to Sass
## Treehouse Techdegree Project 5
One of 12 **_Front End Web Development_** projects at [Treehouse Techdegree Courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development)

## Project Desription
In this project I converted a CSS stylesheet to Sass.

* I refactored the stylesheet from the [Build a Responsive Layout](https://github.com/dmitriyaa/techdegree-project-2) project using SCSS partials, variables, extends, and mixins.
* I also utilized the advantages of [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) methodology naming convention and [SMACSS](https://smacss.com) methodology project structure.
